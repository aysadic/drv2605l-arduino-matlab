# DRV2605L Arduino Driver for MATLAB
I have written this MATLAB script for DRV2605L Haptic Motor Driver according to protocol documented in Texas Instruments DRV2605L datasheet.

For more info you can check out [HERE](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv2605l.pdf?ts=1611413384762&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Fproduct%252FDRV2605L)

You can edit the parameters according to motor type, target frequency and immersion haptic library.

The code is a work-in-progress
